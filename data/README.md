# Dataset

For the graph-graph classification dataset, please download files in this repository and put it to appropriate place which is mentioned in the README.md.
CFGs of FFmpeg are derived directly from binaries compiled from source code on the official website([link](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)). 
As for OpenSSL, we filtered the original CFG data from this [repo](https://github.com/xiaojunxu/dnn-binary-code-similarity) and got these sub-datasets files for experiments.

For the graph-graph regression dataset, please refer to https://github.com/yunshengb/SimGNN .
